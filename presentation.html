        <h1>HISTOIRE DE LA SOCIETE</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            <strong>JP COMPANY LIMITED</strong> was born from a partnership between <strong>JACK TURNER</strong> an Englishman
            from a long line of people who have become masters in the art of alcohol production of all kinds and
            <strong>THOMAS EVERTHON</strong>, an American politician and businessman. Originally <strong>JACK TURNER</strong> through
            reseller in the USA was done. But after the adoption of the XVIII <sup>th</sup> amendment to the Constitution they see themselves obliged
            to smuggle the drink, a decision that every month becomes more and more complicated for him
            because income is falling. He then decides to associate with American politicians indeed he had wind that
            some do not like this decision. Having heard the news <strong>THOMAS EVERTHON</strong>, decides to answer this
            calls, because having tasted one of the bottles of <strong>JACK TURNER</strong>, is certain of the profitability of the drink. This is how he takes
            a plane and go meet him and they sign the partnership contract. A few years later no longer ends prohibition
            despite this they decide to remain in partnership and even to found <strong>the JP COMPANY LIMITED</strong> on a common fund.
